    % What are the main contributions?

    % Do we really want to do goal recognition at this point? This is plan recognition for multiple agents (being a series of single-agent planning problems with the possibility to have them be co-operative if possible) - isn't it?

    % In goal rec, paragraph about ENHSP but don't mention specific planner until the experimentation.

    % What kind of actions can be taken from the timetabling problem? We have a weekly granularity -- we can't do anything about this at this stage. What would we require in the model to meaningfuly do this.
    
    % How can we make this slightly more complex so it is a challenge for planning/goal recognition.
    
    % Showcase the meaningful problem.
    
    % Check planning problems for PDDL -- I've contacted Eva Onaindia about this, to no avail.
    
    % what happens if a student fails? hypothesis for resit? - I get why, but wouldn't that just be common sense? Wouldn't it be advisable to assume that would be the case in the first place?
    
    % unidentified support need??? can we develop this into something that is not strictly another timetabling problems? -- this is a good idea, but we need to be careful about how we do this. An unidentified support need would imply that we know enough about the student to know that they may be at risk of possibly having one, so would it be an opinion that the student itself would have to have?

    % What if we could compare the results of the discrete plan against the continuous one? How would that faire? 

    % Story of helping students -- provide additional insights against other formalisations.

    % List of elements that make the domain more complex -- we can say as to why what we have will have more impact.
    % Agents have non-overlapping sets of actions and local-sensing in a sense. 

    % Put PDDL as supplementary material; replace precons and effects with straight logic - if appropriate.
