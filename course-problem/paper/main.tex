    % What are the main contributions? We know about the formalisation of the problem -- but what about the possibility of the learning costs? why the reward function? are these things necessary?

    % Do we really want to do goal recognition at this point? what do we recognise? one of the things that we want to do with this domain is to design this bespoke course schedules -- would it be the same domain that we use to generate domains? these are questions we need to think about. In goal rec, paragraph about ENHSP but don't mention specific planner until the experimentation.

    % Costing is kind of useful - but we need to make an argument to justify the costing of certain actions -- as some of these are subjective. There is a pattern there. We can reduce the domain even further by using a 'before' keyword. Weeks could be implemented to the same effect as the extra-currics.

    % Encode requirements as a predicate -- then send to the boss to see how we get on with the PDDL domain.

    % The other thing is the paper from Garrido -- Present it for this Friday?? -- See how we get on

    % What if the students has a mental breakdown = What about remedial actions?
