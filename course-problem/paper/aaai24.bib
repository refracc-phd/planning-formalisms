  abstract  = {The paper presents a new relaxation for hybrid planning with continuous numeric and propositional state variables based on subgoaling, generalising the subgoaling principle underlying the h max and h add heuristics to such problems. Our relaxation improves on existing interval-based relaxations by taking into account some negative interactions between effects when achieving a subgoal, resulting in better estimates. We show conditions on the planning model ensuring that this new relaxation leads to tractable, and, for the h max version, admissible, heuristics. The new relaxation can be combined with the interval-based relaxation, to derive heuristics applicable to general numeric planning, while still providing more informed estimates for the subgoals that meet these conditions. Experiments show the effectiveness of its inadmissible and admissible version on satisficing and optimal numeric planning, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first admissible heuristic enabling cost-optimal numeric planning.},

  abstract  = {We generalise the interval-based relaxation to sequential numeric planning problems with non-linear conditions and effects, and cyclic dependencies. This effectively removes all the limitations on the problem placed in previous work on numeric planning heuristics, and even allows us to extend the planning language with a wider set of mathematical functions. Heuristics obtained from the generalised relaxation are pruning-safe. We derive one such heuristic and use it to solve discrete-time control-like planning problems with autonomous processes. Few planners can solve such problems, and search with our new heuristic compares favourably with them.},
