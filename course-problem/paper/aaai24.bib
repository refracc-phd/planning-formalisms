  abstract  = {This paper presents an algorithm for multi-agent strategic modeling (MASM) applied in a robotic soccer domain. It transforms a multi-agent action sequence into a set of strategic action descriptions in a graphical and symbolic form. By using hierarchically ordered domain knowledge, the algorithm is able to generate graphic and symbolic strategic action descriptions together with corresponding rules at different levels of abstraction. The method was evaluated on the RoboCup Soccer Server Internet League data.},

  abstract   = {Designing games is a complicated and time-consuming process, where developing new levels for existing games can take weeks. Procedural content generation offers the potential to shorten this timeframe, however, automated design tools are not adopted widely in the game industry. This article presents an expert evaluation of a human-in-the-loop generative design approach for commercial game maps that incorporates multiple computational agents. The evaluation aims to gauge the extent to which such an approach could support and be accepted by human game designers and to determine whether the computational agents improve the overall design. To evaluate the approach, 11 game designers utilized the approach to design game levels with the computational agents both active and inactive. Eye-tracking, observational, and think-aloud data was collected to determine whether designers favored levels suggested by the computational agents. This data was triangulated with qualitative data from semi-structured interviews that were used to gather overall opinions of the approach. The eye-tracking data indicates that the participating game level designers showed a clear preference for levels suggested by the computational agents, however, expert designers in particular appeared to reject the idea that the computational agents are helpful. The perception of computational tools not being useful needs to be addressed if procedural content generation approaches are to fulfill their potential for the game industry.},

  abstract = {Recognizing the actions, plans, and goals of a person in an unconstrained environment is a key feature that future robotic systems will need in order to achieve a natural human-machine interaction. Indeed, we humans are constantly understanding and predicting the actions and goals of others, which allows us to interact in intuitive and safe ways. While action and plan recognition are tasks that humans perform naturally and with little effort, they are still an unresolved problem from the point of view of artificial intelligence. The immense variety of possible actions and plans that may be encountered in an unconstrained environment makes current approaches be far from human-like performance. In addition, while very different types of algorithms have been proposed to tackle the problem of activity, plan, and goal (intention) recognition, these tend to focus in only one part of the problem (e.g., action recognition), and techniques that address the problem as a whole have been not so thoroughly explored. This review is meant to provide a general view of the problem of activity, plan, and goal recognition as a whole. It presents a description of the problem, both from the human perspective and from the computational perspective, and proposes a classification of the main types of approaches that have been proposed to address it (logic-based, classical machine learning, deep learning, and brain-inspired), together with a description and comparison of the classes. This general view of the problem can help on the identification of research gaps, and may also provide inspiration for the development of new approaches that address the problem in a unified way.}

  abstract  = {An important aspect of partial-order planning is the resolution of threats between actions and causal links in a plan. We present a technique for automatically deciding which threats should be resolved during planning, and which should be delayed until planning is otherwise complete. In particular we show that many potential threats can be provably delayed until the end; that is, if the planner can find a plan for the goal while ignoring these threats, there is a guarantee that the partial ordering in the resulting plan can be extended to eliminate the threats.Our technique involves: 1) construction of an operator graph that captures the interaction between operators relevant to a given goal, 2) decomposition of this graph into groups of related threats, and 3) postponement of threats with certain properties.},

  abstract  = {Multi-Agent Plan Recognition (MAPR) aims to recognize dynamic team structures and team behaviours from the observed team traces (activity sequences) of a set of intelligent agents. Previous MAPR approaches required a library of team activity sequences (team plans) be given as input. However, collecting a library of team plans to ensure adequate coverage is often difficult and costly. In this paper, we relax this constraint, so that team plans are not required to be provided beforehand. We assume instead that a set of action models are available. Such models are often already created to describe domain physics; i.e., the preconditions and effects of effects actions. We propose a novel approach for recognizing multi-agent team plans based on such action models rather than libraries of team plans. We encode the resulting MAPR problem as a satisfiability problem and solve the problem using a state-of-the-art weighted MAX-SAT solver. Our approach also allows for incompleteness in the observed plan traces. Our empirical studies demonstrate that our algorithm is both effective and efficient in comparison to state-of-the-art MAPR methods based on plan libraries.},

  abstract  = {Recent years have seen a growing interest in player modeling for digital games. Goal recognition, which aims to accurately recognize players' goals from observations of low-level player actions, is a key problem in player modeling. However, player goal recognition poses significant challenges because of the inherent complexity and uncertainty pervading gameplay. In this paper, we formulate player goal recognition as a sequence labeling task and introduce a goal recognition framework based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Results show that LSTM-based goal recognition is significantly more accurate than previous state-of-the-art methods, including n -gram encoded feedforward neural networks pre-trained with stacked denoising autoencoders, as well as Markov logic network-based models. Because of increased goal recognition accuracy and the elimination of labor-intensive feature engineering, LSTM-based goal recognition provides an effective solution to a central problem in player modeling for open-world digital games.},

Object-nav has been extensively studied by the Embodied-AI community, but most solutions are often restricted to considering static objects (e.g., television, fridge, etc.), We propose a modular framework for object-nav that is able to efficiently search indoor environments for not just static objects but also movable objects (e.g. fruits, glasses, phones, etc.) that frequently change their positions due to human intervention. Our contextual-bandit agent efficiently explores the environment by showing optimism in the face of uncertainty and learns a model of the likelihood of spotting different objects from each navigable location. The likelihoods are used as rewards in a weighted minimum latency solver to deduce a trajectory for the robot. We evaluate our algorithms in two simulated environments and a real-world setting, to demonstrate high sample efficiency and reliability.},

These approaches, however, assume that there is a domain expert capable of building complete and correct domain knowledge to successfully recognize an agent's goal. This is too strong for most real-world applications. We overcome these limitations by combining goal recognition techniques from automated planning, and deep autoencoders to carry out unsupervised learning to generate domain theories from data streams and use the resulting domain theories to deal with incomplete and noisy observations. We show the effectiveness of the technique in a number of domains and compare the recognition effectiveness of the autoencoded against hand-coded versions of these domains.},

  abstract  = {It is important for autonomous vehicles to have the ability to infer the goals of other vehicles (goal recognition), in order to safely interact with other vehicles and predict their future trajectories. This is a difficult problem, especially in urban environments with interactions between many vehicles. Goal recognition methods must be fast to run in real time and make accurate inferences. As autonomous driving is safety- critical, it is important to have methods which are human interpretable and for which safety can be formally verified. Existing goal recognition methods for autonomous vehicles fail to satisfy all four objectives of being fast, accurate, interpretable and verifiable. We propose Goal Recognition with Interpre table Trees (GRIT), a goal recognition system which achieves these objectives. GRIT makes use of decision trees trained on vehicle trajectory data. We evaluate GRIT on two datasets, showing that GRIT achieved fast inference speed and comparable accuracy to two deep learning baselines, a planning-based goal recognition method, and an ablation of GRIT. We show that the learned trees are human interpretable and demonstrate how properties of GRIT can be formally verified using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver.},

  abstract   = {The mechanisms of emergence and evolution of collective behaviours in dynamical Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) of multiple interacting agents, with diverse behavioral strategies in co-presence, have been undergoing mathematical study via Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT). Their systematic study also resorts to agent-based modelling and simulation (ABM) techniques, thus enabling the study of aforesaid mechanisms under a variety of conditions, parameters, and alternative virtual games. This paper summarises some main research directions and challenges tackled in our group, using methods from EGT and ABM. These range from the introduction of cognitive and emotional mechanisms into agents’ implementation in an evolving MAS, to the cost-efficient interference for promoting prosocial behaviours in complex networks, to the regulation and governance of AI safety development ecology, and to the equilibrium analysis of random evolutionary multi-player games. This brief aims to sensitize the reader to EGT based issues, results and prospects, which are accruing in importance for the modeling of minds with machines and the engineering of prosocial behaviours in dynamical MAS, with impact on our understanding of the emergence and stability of collective behaviours. In all cases, important open problems in MAS research as viewed or prioritised by the group are described.},

  abstract  = {Renewable Energy Integration: Practical Management of
               Variability, Uncertainty, and Flexibility in Power Grids, Second
               Edition, offers a distilled examination of the intricacies of
               integrating renewables into power grids and electricity markets.
               It offers informed perspectives from internationally renowned
               experts on related challenges and solutions based on
               demonstrated best practices developed by operators around the
               world. The book's focus on practical implementation of
               strategies provides real-world context for the theoretical
               underpinnings and the development of supporting policy
               frameworks. The second edition considers myriad integration
               issues, thus ensuring that grid operators with low or high
               penetration of renewable generation can leverage the best
               practices achieved by their peers. It includes revised chapters
               from the first edition as well as new chapters. Lays out the key
               issues around the integration of renewables into power grids and
               markets, from the intricacies of operational and planning
               considerations to supporting regulatory and policy frameworks.
               Provides updated global case studies that highlight the
               challenges of renewables integration and present field-tested
               solutions and new Forewords from Europe, United Arab Emirates,
               and United States. Illustrates technologies to support the
               management of variability, uncertainty, and flexibility in power
               grids.},

  abstract  = {Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in interactive narrative-centered virtual environments for education, training, and entertainment. Narrative environments dynamically craft engaging story-based experiences for users, who are themselves active participants in unfolding stories. A key challenge posed by interactive narrative is recognizing users' goals so that narrative planners can dynamically orchestrate plot elements and character actions to create rich, customized stories. In this paper we present an inductive approach to predicting users' goals by learning probabilistic goal recognition models. This approach has been evaluated in a narrative environment for the domain of microbiology in which the user plays the role of a medical detective solving a science mystery. An empirical evaluation of goal recognition based on n-gram models and Bayesian networks suggests that the models offer significant predictive power.},

In this paper, we develop a method based on the operator-counting framework that efficiently computes solutions that satisfy the observations and uses the information generated to solve goal recognition tasks. Our method reasons explicitly about both partial and noisy observations: estimating uncertainty for the former, and satisfying observations given the unreliability of the sensor for the latter. We evaluate our approach empirically over a large data set, analyzing its components on how each can impact the quality of the solutions. In general, our approach is superior to previous methods in terms of agreement ratio, accuracy, and spread. Finally, our approach paves the way for new research on combinatorial optimization to solve goal recognition tasks.},

  abstract  = {The paper presents a new relaxation for hybrid planning with continuous numeric and propositional state variables based on subgoaling, generalising the subgoaling principle underlying the h max and h add heuristics to such problems. Our relaxation improves on existing interval-based relaxations by taking into account some negative interactions between effects when achieving a subgoal, resulting in better estimates. We show conditions on the planning model ensuring that this new relaxation leads to tractable, and, for the h max version, admissible, heuristics. The new relaxation can be combined with the interval-based relaxation, to derive heuristics applicable to general numeric planning, while still providing more informed estimates for the subgoals that meet these conditions. Experiments show the effectiveness of its inadmissible and admissible version on satisficing and optimal numeric planning, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first admissible heuristic enabling cost-optimal numeric planning.},

This effectively removes all the limitations on the problem placed in previous work on numeric planning heuristics, and even allows us to extend the planning language with a wider set of mathematical functions. Heuristics obtained from the generalised relaxation are pruning-safe. We derive one such heuristic and use it to solve discrete-time control-like planning problems with autonomous processes. Few planners can solve such problems, and search with our new heuristic compares favourably with them.},
