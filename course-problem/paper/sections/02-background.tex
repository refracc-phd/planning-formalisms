\section{Background}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Background of Goal Recognition},~\citet{meneguzzi2021survey} for general planning/goal recognition info, and~\citet{Scala2016,ScalaHaslum2016} for ENHSP\@.
    \item \textbf{Existing educational support systems and their limitations}, like how~\citet{Garrido2009} cannot monitor the learning routes, similar to intelligent tutoring systems;~\citet{Rojas2022} covers collaborative problem-solving and providing feedback in real-time, but does not necessarily provide an application to a classroom.
    \item \textbf{Theoretical framework and concepts related to goal recognition} \textemdash~add definitions, but put in paragraph form and not in definition tags.
    \item \textbf{Overview of related work in the field of using AI and planning for educational assistance}~\cite{Castillo2009} summary.
    \item \textbf{The specific challenges faced by secondary education that necessitate innovative solutions}, diversity of learning styles and technological integration of learning solutions \textbf{TODO: Find Material}.
